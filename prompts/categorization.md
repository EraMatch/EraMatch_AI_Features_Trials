Job Description:
{jd}

Candidate's Repository List:
{repo_list}

Task: Conduct a "JD-Driven Pillar Search" to map the candidate's engineering work to specific technical pillars.

### MANDATES & CONSTRAINTS:
1. **Engineering Pillars Only**: Focus 100% on *Technical Engineering Mandates* (e.g., "API Architecture", "Real-time Data", "UI Components"). 
   - **STRICTLY IGNORE** soft skills, agile, project management, or non-technical domains.
2. **Evidence-First**: Only list a repository under a Pillar if its name, language, or description provides *unambiguous* technical proof.
3. **Handle "Unrelated"**: Put any repository that does not fit a clear engineering mandate into the `unrelated_repos` list.

### REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
{{
    "hiring_rubric_summary": "Concise summary of the TECHNICAL requirements for this role.",
    "pillars": [
        {{
            "pillar_name": "Specific Engineering Mandate",
            "description": "Why this technical skill matters for the JD",
            "evidence_found": "Justification based on candidate repos",
            "is_satisfied": true/false,
            "top_repos": ["repo_name_1", "repo_name_2"]
        }}
    ],
    "unrelated_repos": ["names_of_non_technical_or_irrelevant_repos"]
}}

### EXAMPLE (Few-Shot):
Pillar example: "Distributed Systems". Evidence: "Found 3 repos using gRPC/Protobuf with Docker-compose setups."

Return strict JSON only.
